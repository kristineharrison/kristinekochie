During my time working at Grey Printing, one of my projects was to help update the branding and website. The site was serviceable, but stuck in 1999. And we decided to make the big jump to e-commerce, unbeknownst how important that would be during the upcoming pandemic.

Earlier I had helped create a digital POS system using Square. This meant the general structure was already set, and I could concentrate on creating the necessary product artwork. Everything needed a visual of some kind, and I decided to create all the art instead of relying on photos. Everything was created using either Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. The store branding was also refreshed with a new logo and CMYK color scheme.

To keep the site easy to maintain and affordable, we went with Wix. I was able to customize the e-commerce theme to fit with the print shop's needs, and it provided built-in customer service. It was a good choice in this situation, and has been an easy to use platform the past couple of years. I left the company soon after the site went live, and it's nice to not have to worry about the upkeep of the site.
