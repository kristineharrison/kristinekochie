I worked with Robin on creating a custom WordPress site for her campaign for Town of Wappinger Supervisor. She requested a site that was easy to navigate and showcased her priorities, and would be able to add a blog section at a later date. We decided to go with a WordPress site so she would be able to easily create posts and maintain a mailing list on her own.

I took design queues off the logo she already had, which used the green and blue color theme and the Google web font Montserrat. The responsive design uses the standard breakpoints
