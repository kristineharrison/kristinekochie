One of the first courses I took was the Web Design for Everybody: Basics of Web Development and Coding specialization offered by the University of Michigan through Coursera. The course was broken down into five sections, with the final being a website that ties everything together. I enjoyed this course overall, even though it was more a review of familiar material.

Official description:

> This Specialization covers how to write syntactically correct HTML5 and
> CSS3, and how to create interactive web experiences with JavaScript.
> Mastering this range of technologies will allow you to develop high
> quality web sites that, work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and large
> screen browsers accessible. During the capstone you will develop a
> professional-quality web portfolio demonstrating your growth as a
> web developer and your knowledge of accessible web design. This will
> include your ability to design and implement a responsive site that
> utilizes tools to create a site that is accessible to a wide audience,
> including those with visual, audial, physical, and cognitive impairments.

I decided to have fun with the capstone project and create a site for my Cookbook Club. Several years ago, a couple of friends and I decided to form a Cookbook Club, where we would pick a cookbook, and then individually choose a recipe and cook it for a group dinner. We end up with a multi-course meal that works beautifully together, and of course, a dinner with friends.

The site is developed with Vanilla JavasScript, HTML5, and CSS3. It is designed mobile-first with responsive layouts for tables and desktops. I created all the imagery with Adobe Photoshop, and did the design layout in Adobe XD.

The current site works as a basic intro to our group, and in the future I would love to make it more interactive. It would be great to have an area to share recipes and chat about future book selections.
