### _* Long Form *_

Full stack developer with more than 20 years of digital and print design, tech operations, and data management experience in a variety of industries. From creating digital archives to founding and managing a retail store and ecommerce business, my experience in tech-adjacent roles enables me to be both pragmatic and forward-thinking. I aim to utilize my design and development skills with current technology to build seamless and dynamic user-friendly experiences.

### _* TLDR *_

I have spent the last twenty years in a variety of creative fields, from the start-up of a photo agency, working in the print industry, and even owning my own small business.

Now I am a middle-aged cat lady learning how to code.
