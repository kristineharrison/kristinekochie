#### Hi, I'm Kristine Kochie and I'm a Full Stack Developer.

Who exactly am I?
Well, I have more than 20 years of digital and print design, tech operations, and data management experience in a variety of fields. From creating digital archives to founding and managing a retail store and e-commerce business, my history in tech-adjacent roles enables me to be both pragmatic and forward-thinking. I want to utilize my design and development skills with current tech to build seamless and dynamic user-friendly experiences.

You might notice I don't have a “traditional” Software Engineering background. I built my first website way back in 1999, and over the past 2 decades have dabbled with various platforms and languages. But I didn’t seriously believe I could make tech a career until recently, when I decided to enroll in Flatiron School’s Software Engineering program.

My Flatiron experience was life-changing. Not only did I find out I can learn at an accelerated pace, but that I love everything about it. Programming languages, frameworks, libraries... throw them at me!

Since I come from a variety of past experiences, I view problems differently. I’ve had to be creative and innovative in order to make things work, quite frequently with limited resources and time. Coupled with this knowledge, I am committed to enhancing my proficiency and abilities and regularly work on improving my coding skills.

## TL;DR

I have spent the last twenty years in a variety of creative fields, from the start-up of a photo agency, working in the print industry, and even owning my own small business.

Now I am a middle-aged cat lady who jumped into the tech world.
