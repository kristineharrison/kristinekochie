### Hi, I'm Kristine Kochie and I love to build things.

Who exactly am I?

Well, I have more than 20 years of digital and print design, tech operations, and data management experience in a variety of fields. From creating digital archives to founding and managing a retail store and e-commerce business, I've covered a lot of ground. I have an artist's eye for detail, and a programmer's love of logic.

You might notice I don't have a “traditional” Software Engineering background. I built my first website way back in 1999, and over the past 2 decades have dabbled with various platforms and languages. Lots of WordPress, static HTML and playing with whatever was new on the scene. But I didn’t seriously believe I could make tech a career until recently, when I decided to enroll in Flatiron School’s Software Engineering program. Now I am focusing full-time on creating sites and apps from start-to-finish / front-to-back.

Want to build something together? [Get in touch!](mailto:kristinekochie@gmail.com) Would especially love to work on projects local to New York's Hudson Valley.

### TL;DR

I have spent the last twenty years in a variety of creative fields, from the start-up of a photo agency, working in the print industry, and even owning my own small business.

Now I am a middle-aged cat lady who jumped into the tech world.
